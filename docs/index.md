Welcome to `pynajax`, a GPU accelerated backend for `pynapple` built on top on `JAX`.

__The package is under active development and more methods will be added in the future.__


__For this package to work, `pynapple` must be installed from the branch `pynajax`.__


## Installation
Run the following `pip` command in your virtual environment.

**For macOS/Linux users:**
 ```bash
 pip install git+https://github.com/pynapple-org/pynajax.git
 ```

**For Windows users:**
 ```
 python -m pip install git+https://github.com/pynapple-org/pynajax.git
 ```

## Basic usage

To use pynajax, you need to change the pynapple backend using `nap.nap_config.set_backend`. See the example below : 

```python
import pynapple as nap
import numpy as np
nap.nap_config.set_backend("jax")

tsd = nap.Tsd(t=np.arange(100), d=np.random.randn(100))

tsd.convolve(np.ones(11)) # This will run on GPU or CPU depending on the jax installation
```

## Benchmarks

This benchmark for the `convolve` function was run on a NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1060.

Please note that this package is currently under development. While you can
download and test the functionalities that are already present, please be aware
